# Human Language Technologies (HLT) @ Augsburg, Germany

W3IDs for various services and datasets provided by the HLT (NLP/DH) labs at the [University of Augsburg, Germany](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/) (UniA), and the [Technical University of Applied Sciences Augsburg, Germany](https://www.tha.de/en) (THA), see https://hlt-augsburg.github.io/.

For specs, see https://w3id.org. Edit .htaccess file according to https://wiki.selfhtml.org/wiki/Webserver/htaccess/Umleitungen_mit_mod_rewrite.

It is likely that this redirection does not support all we need. We need aliases not only for for conventional websites and datasets (these should work), but also to login servers (probably not, because this is not operating via the HTTP protocol). We probably need our own DNS server for that.
